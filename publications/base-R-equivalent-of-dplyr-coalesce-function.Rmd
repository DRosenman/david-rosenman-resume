```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The dplyr function `coalesce` is incredibly useful and similar to SQL `COALESCE` function. Given a set of vectors, it finds and keeps the first non-`NA` value at each position. For example, the following code returns the vector `c(1,2,3,4)`.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
coalesce(c(1, NA, 3, NA), c(2, 2, 4,4))
```
